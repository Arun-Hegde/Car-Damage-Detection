# 🚘 Vehicle Damage Detection App  

This Streamlit web app allows you to **upload or drag & drop** an image of a car and instantly get predictions about **the type of damage** it has.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** The model performs best when the uploaded image shows the **third-quarter front or rear view** of a vehicle, as that’s what it was trained on.

## 🧠 Model Overview  

This project uses **transfer learning with ResNet50** to classify vehicle damage from images.  

**Model Specifications:**
1. **Architecture:** ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet)
2. **Training Data:** ~1,700 labeled car images  
3. **Target Classes (6 total):**
   - Front Normal  
   - Front Crushed  
   - Front Breakage  
   - Rear Normal  
   - Rear Crushed  
   - Rear Breakage  
4. **Validation Accuracy:** ~80%
